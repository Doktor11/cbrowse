TODO for final project

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	- Want a way to sort similar URLs that have one or more different part
	  Perhaps a fine-grained splitting of URLs? Look for sets that share
	  almost all elements, separate out the different parts
	  - Would involve splitting the netloc by '.', path by '/', params by ';'
	    query by '&', fragment by something else
	  - Looks like there can also be queries or params in other parts of the
	    URL... So have to do splitting within each section
          - Want to keep split parts in order
	  - Perhaps allow a customizable "similarity threshold", meaning a number
	    of differences to tolerate before considreing something a separate URL
	    or could there be a way of determining this dynamically?
	  - Some URLs have other URLs within them, as part of the query for instance
	  - URLs that are split into different length lists would automatically be
	    considered non-similar
	  - Data structure implementation: a list of lists of dictionaries	
	  - Additional assumption: all URLs that could possibly be considered similar
	    will be grouped together
